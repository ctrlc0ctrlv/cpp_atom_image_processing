# Overview
C++ code for my course work "Image Processing Algorithms and Automation of Detection of Arrays of Single Neutral Atoms" which was carried out at the Department of Quantum Electronics on the Physical Faculty of Moscow State University.

# Note
Since this code was written for the lab, it will not be quiet useful for anybody except our lab, but it still shows my C++ skills
